The .p4ignore file and enableP4ignore.bat need to be located at the root directory of your unity project.
The first time you, on any computer, open a unity project from a p4 depot, you need to run the bat-file on that computer before you add anything to your changelist. (yes, every team members needs to run the bat file on their machines, as the config is completely client-side)
assuming you've put the files in the correct folder you only need to run the bat-file once per Unity project per workspace.
